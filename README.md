Group: GAN Styles.
Members: Renjie Zhao, Jared Pham, Joseph Walker


Description
===========



Requirements
============
The demo needs the models and imaages to load:

Code organization
=================
cyclegandemo.ipynb -- Run a demo of our code 

training_base_model.ipynb -- Run the training of the Monet base model for CycleGANs

test_models.ipynb -- Notebook used to view results on random images on the models. 

neuralstyle.ipynb - Neural Style Transfer that can be run on DSMLP

neuralstyle_preprocess.ipynb - Neural Style transfer that was run on google colab. Normalized input and equations written out.
